# My Personal Automated Setup for my Phones

### *This Project is currently on my planned "to-do" list, it also means that it might not ever be completed.*

I am indecisive as shit when it comes to phones, and switch between them often, therefore I think it would be actually helpful for me to automate some of my setup process, especially around the de-bloating/customization of the devices.

Currently only testing with 2 phones:
- Samsung Galaxy S23+
- Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3
- iPhone 14 Pro Max

I would like to use Ansible for this, but it seems there isn't much around Android/iOS support lol.
